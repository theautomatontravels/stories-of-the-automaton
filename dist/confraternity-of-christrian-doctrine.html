    <h1>the automaton</h1><a href="index.html">home</a><article><h2>Confraternity of Christrian Doctrine</h2><p>When I was a child I went to something called <i>CCD</i>. Most of the children in the small Minnesota town went too. I never knew what CCD stood for, and I don’t think any of the other children did either.</p><p>As an adult in a big Minnesota city, I asked my peers if they had to do the same thing, had to go to CCD. I don’t think anyone I ever asked said they did. Though sometimes they said they went to something similar with a different name. The internet says that CCD stands for the <i>Confraternity of Christrian Doctrine</i>, and that the classes are hundreds of years old.</p><p>A CCD class took at least a dozen days of someone’s childhood in total. A child would have to attend classes for something like six or seven years. All the children would gather in the Catholic school house across the street from one of the town’s eighteen churches. At the beginning of each year, every child got a workbook and they’d had to remember to bring it to class every week. The workbook contained teachings from the Bible, with cartoon images of white people from Israel and Egypt reenacting stories from the Bible.</p><p>I can’t remember if the workbook cost money, or if my mom and other kids’ moms had to pay for the classes and the workbook. Maybe the local church paid for the books, and that’s what the donation basket that went around on Sunday church services was for. It might have even been paid for by the Bush Administration’s No Child Left Behind policy.</p><p>The workbooks were brand spanking new every year. I imagine whoever published and sold them must have made a mint. Any American worth their salt knows the best businesses are those that make brand new products that will hardly get used. As a student of the American education system under George W. Bush’s, I knew that all the best modern products were made with or because of Middle Eastern petroleum.</p><p>During the Christian doctrine classes we’d take turns reading from the pages of the workbook, or we’d have some kind of writing activity to do. Over the course of the year we’d maybe make it through two whole chapters of the workbook’s few dozen. Though not because we’d spent the time doing writing activities. It was not only the case that we were inattentive children. The teachers were not certified professionals, only volunteers.</p><p>One volunteer teacher was an old woman who’d always interrupt us from readings to teach us religious thought. For example one day she taught us that “He” was watching us whenever we were in “His house.” As she said this, she pointed a finger upwards, toward the church in the window behind us. Everyone in the class thought she was pointing at something in the room, maybe on a poster on the wall or maybe on the ceiling.</p><p>Seeing that she confused the class, she asked us if we knew <i>who</i> she was talking about when she said “He,” if we knew <i>what</i> she talking about when she said “His House.”</p><p>Age had sunken the features of her face. Time had turned her teeth colors I’d never seen before, and her explanation seethed through them. She said that she was referring to God when she said “He,” and that “His house” was the church. Not just the church behind the schoolhouse, but any church, any holy building. It seemed like she was saying something real sinister when she said that God was watching us at that very moment.</p><p>At that point in my life I believed that anything at the schoolhouse would be sinister. Being part of the town’s secular school system, the only things I heard about it were things that schoolchildren would gossip about. Opinions like “<i>This</i> teacher is constantly angry,” or rumors like “<i>that</i> teacher drinks during the day,” even stories like “one teacher broke a student’s finger in a desk.”</p><p>My own gossip was that God was watching over the schoolhouse all the time, so that he could call the cops on you if you were there doing something He didn’t like. My first time getting blackout drunk happened at the trailer park just up the street. The school had a playground with a swing set so of course we drunkenly sauntered over to it during the wee morning hours.</p><p>I told kids that it was true that God’s cops would show up. When we went drunk, they came to talk to us. They didn’t tell us to leave, just questioned us so we’d be too scared to stay. I don’t remember it but I’m told that I couldn’t stand up straight without holding on to the side of their police cruiser. We went back to the trailer park afterwards.</p><p>There was a different volunteer teacher who had a similar affinity for alcohol. He was the son of the CCD program’s administrator. One day he gloated to the class of teenagers about his prior week’s adventure. Historically this was about the time that cell phones were becoming popular, so he mentioned having captured photos of what made the night so boastful. He said he’d captured photos of girls kissing each other at the bar.</p><p>After hearing this, the class could not be calmed down. We were too excited about cell phones and too horny about the imitation <i>Girls Gone Wild</i>. We could not be bothered by our workbooks any longer. There were glorious photos to be seen on a digital one-and-a-half inch cell phone display.</p><p>Eventually, the administrator’s son did get us to calm down. The bastard said he wasn’t going to share the photos. Since there wasn’t enough time left to do the rest of the workbook readings for the day we had to move on to another planned activity. The activity was to write down all of the Ten Commandments that we could remember.</p><p>I couldn’t remember too many of them. Just the one about not stealing and the one about not killing. So I wrote those two down. “Thou shalt not steal,” and “Thou shalt not kill.” I felt awful remembering so few.</p><p>I knew there wasn’t any use in cheating since the class didn’t have any grades, or any point that I’d known about. I still peeked at my classmates’ worksheets though. Travis sitting next to me was almost through the whole list! I didn’t want anyone to look at my worksheet and think I was a complete dunce, so I wrote down something relevant to current events, something also that I thought would be funny to anyone who’d take the time to read it if they peeked. I wrote down “Thou shalt not touch little boys.”</p><p>At the time, current events were about people within the papacy having been regularly molesting little boys. Though I knew it had nothing to do with the assignment, what I wrote down did have something to do with reconciling my belief in God. Even if I did write it to be funny, it seemed like something that for sure should have been on the list of Commandments, or at least an honorable mention. Had it been mentioned, I might have been more cognizant of the problem. I might have been a less despicable person myself, who knows.</p><p>The next part of the story exemplifies the unbelievable upper bound of communication speeds. Though not the kinds defined within Claude Shannon’s mathematical theory; but rather those of Divine Communication.</p><p>Somehow, the CCD administrator was able to hear about my Three Commandments from her son. Then, before class ended, she was able to arrange a meeting between herself, myself and my mom. When class ended, instead of walking out to the school’s parking lot to my mom picking me up, I was surprised to see my mom in the hallway telling me we needed to go to the administrator’s office at the school.</p><p>In the office, the administrator recounted what I had done. She even had proof in hand, sliding the worksheet with my Three Commandments across the desk. I don’t remember what my mom’s response was. My mom isn’t one for words. I recently got her a book, later asked her if she’d started reading it. She told me she hadn’t by saying that she thinks she needs to get reading glasses.</p><p>My mom was probably dumbfounded, at a loss for words. That’s a trait I picked up from her that I know all too well. Had she been better equipped characteristically, I might have my Three Commandments as a trophy for how I refuted Christian doctrine. She might have even been able to save some of the artwork I painted later in my life that the secular school system threw away for its apparent vulgarity.</p><p>It was a shameful and silent walk from the administrator’s office back to the car. In the car my mom scolded me in true Minnesotan fashion. She said, “Why did you have to do something to make me have to go in there and listen to that?” My response was something like “Why do I have to go to CCD?” Clearly I was still trying to reconcile my faith in God. I think my mom was too, because that was either the last or second-to-last year I learned about Christian doctrine there.</p><p>She did give me a real response to my interrogative retort, however. She said that the church could refuse to perform my marriage ceremony later in life if I didn’t complete CCD.</p></article>
