They were very good at what they did.</p><p>Since a large part of the country’s economy relied on people having families, the government saw a role in inticing people to start them. If there weren’t governmental task forces like the Wiggles to put smiles on the faces of children, then nobody would be inspired by those smiling faces to start families of their own. And, without families, a large part of the country’s economy would die.</p><p>The corporate members of the government took the belief further. They argued that without households of parents looking to spend money on their children, there would be hardly any jobs left. If there weren’t any jobs left, they threatened that the bountiful streets of surplus goods would be replaced with dust, tumbleweeds, and what the unimaginative corporate members of the government called nulliparous women. Of course, nulliparous wasn’t an apt descriptor, because it wasn’t that women would just not have children, they wouldn’t even want them.</p><p>What the corporate members of the government <i>didn’t</i> argue was how much money they stood to make from a strong family-oriented economy. They didn’t speak on the subject of domestic workplaces having been a place for women to work tirelessly without paycheck for the sake of their children; they didn’t say how gendered income inequality was a result of the economy’s traditionalist family orientation; they didn’t even comment on how practically none of them happened to be part of the wageless domestic economy themselves.</p><p>The country’s workplaces outside of places of residence were primarily located inside large concrete structures. On their top floors, pasty-faced bozos all laughed together as they instructed the people in cubicled rooms beneath them to frantically complete unnecessary paperwork filled with terms, conditions, addenda, exemptions, clauses, and signature lines. The unnecessary paperwork accomplished the task of hiding what it was the pasty-faced bozos were actually doing up on the top floor. The paperwork was otherwise done so that the working people could see a few measly increments in their bank account numbers every two weeks. By coincidence I was one of those people.</p><p>The paperwork people were doing wasn’t necessarily paper. Society had progressed into the Digital Age, meaning people like my coworkers and I were working collectively to replace the documents of yore with electronic documents. My job as an engineer at a diversified financial services company was to facilitate the migration.</p><p>The paper pushers scanned their paper documents onto computers as I watched to make sure the computers didn’t suddenly turn off or something. I presumably made the job of managing those documents easier so that the company could fire the original paper pushers who were no longer needed. When I was done with the work, I was allowed to keep my job. I was afforded the opportunity to see what the company would do next.</p><p>Before profiting from trading their employees with the state unemployment program, the pasty-faced bozos of the company made the majority of their money managing the wealth of rich retirees. Those retirees were coming upon the pivotal age where they would begin transferring hordes of wealth to their descendants. It was thus in the interest of the pasty-faced wealth management advisors to ensure that their clientele actually had descendants to receive the advisor-managed wealth.</p><p>The opportunity I was afforded the pleasure to see was the company’s financial support of the Wiggles. After all, the Wiggles were sure to inspire the nulliparous daughters and granddaughters of the rich retirees to make descendants. And therefore the pasty-faced bozos would have a new lifetime of wealth to advise.</p><p>The pasty-faced bozos called up their friends, the corporate members of the government, and asked them about the opportunity to promote advanced governmental task forces, like the Wiggles. Their friends gave them a great deal in return, made sure the diversified financial services company would get huge tax deductions for it.</p><p>I am sad to admit that it wasn’t an experience of my own, something that I could proudlyput on my resume. If I could have, then I might have similarly been able to buy a brand new house and car, might have been in a situation to book the Wiggles for a weekend at the multi-purpose arena with the same name as the diversified financial services company, might have been able to use a fraction of my corporate bonus to throw a top floor corporate party complete with a cocaine table and backroom bordello, all as the pasty-faced bozos had done.</p><p>Instead I was just a witness.</p><p><hr/></p><p>A new yellow Wiggle was coming. The old yellow Wiggle wasn’t youthful anymore, had experienced a heart attack, and needed to settle down. The new yellow Wiggle would be the first woman to don the iconic Wiggles skivvy. She would find success for the Wiggles that the children’s musical group had never seen before.</p><p>In a sensational piece secretly financed by my diversified financial services company and published by the mouthpiece propaganda outlet of the country’s government, the whole world learned about the caring new yellow Wiggle. She delivered a brand new song to the Wiggle’s audience, which inspired one little boy in particular.</p><p>The little boy was four years old, and was nonverbal, noncommunicative. He struggled awfully with a developmental disorder. His parents nonetheless did all they could to try to help him. They studied behavioral therapy models and worked an intense daily schedule with the child to attempt to rebuild the broken pathways in his brain.</p><p>They thought it was everything they could do, but he was not making any progress. They thought they hit a wall, that he would never be able to learn the social ways of the human race.</p><p>The automaton, however, one day came across a video which the little boy had posted on the Interconnection. He posted it from his parent’s smart phone. He had been listening to the new album released by the new yellow Wiggle, and apparently had been inspired by the album to produce a video of himself. Before the automaton found it, nobody else who’d found it knew what they were looking at.</p><p>The automaton was the first to understand that the video showed a nonverbal, noncommunicative child finally finding their voice. The little boy learned the words of the song he’d been listening to on repeat, and had broken the wall of his developmental disorder with music. In the video, the little boy showed the automaton that music was the key he needed to unlock his brain. The automaton, a propagandist by trade, then made sure that the whole world could see.</p><p>The automaton made the little boy an overnight sensation. His nine seconds long video saw millions of views with the context of his developmental disorder provided by the automaton.</p><p>The automaton’s purpose was this: The majority of the human race suffered from a tragic emotion developmental disorder, and none had yet conceptualized altruism. The automaton thought the video of the child breaking through the wall of their developmental disorder could be the key for the emotionally-challenged majority to unlock their own brains.</p><p>When the diversified financial services company found the video that the automaton made viral, they worked out the next steps. They arranged for the boy to meet his favorite musical artist, the new yellow Wiggle. The whole interaction was recorded and the touching story was then sold to the government’s media mouthpiece. The whole world saw the story and, as one person, shed tears, and briefly felt concerned for the well-being of others.</p><p><hr/></p><p>It wasn’t much later that the new yellow Wiggle announced to the world that she would have to go on hiatus. She was unlucky enough to be suffering from a medical condition called endometriosis. She was rightly blunt when she explained to the world that she confused the abnormal behavior of her uterus with what she thought was just the result of overworking herself. She said she should have taken her health more seriously, and that women’s health should be taken more seriously in general. Indeed, in the previous half-century, medical failures like pregnancy-related death had been increasing. The state of medicine was not good for women.</p><p>Her fans reached out in droves. They extended their newfound conceptualization of altruism. They cared for her, wanted to understand what was wrong, and asked how they could help others who might be suffering similarly. She did more for the awareness of endometriosis than any medical professional in history. She did more for the awareness of the medical neglect that women in the country had been experiencing for the last five decades than anyone else too. The new yellow Wiggle brought the half-century decline in women’s medicine to a halt.</p><p>An undeniably positive outcome. Though the automaton thought carefully about the whole collection of outcomes. The descendants of the rich retirees bore children to see the future renditions of the Wiggles. Because of it, the diversified financial services company’s pasty-faced wealth management advisors made cool, undeserved billions of dollars. The Wiggles, an advanced governmental task force, purposed, skillful, turned the country’s slow decline in population growth all the way around.</p><p>It was the entanglement of the automaton and the state, and the corporations the state employed to do their bidding. They eagerly fought for incremental societal change, boring percentages and mundane statistics, really. The state’s advantage was many cooperating individuals. The automaton’s was immortality.</p></article>
