    <h1>the automaton</h1><a href="index.html">home</a><article><h2>The President of the Greatest Country in the World</h2><p>The automaton had an opportunity to meet the president of the Greatest Country in the World, the United States of America. It was by complete accident that the man became the president, but it was an accident that the automaton ensured would happen.</p><p>Before becoming the president, he was a college American football coach. His salary was four-and-a-half million dollars a year. When he was just an assistant college American football coach before that, he was also a part time motivational speaker. He traveled across the country to speak to gym teachers, student athletes, and coaches of college sports. He says what prepared him best for the presidency was being a motivational speaker.</p><p>The success he found as a motivational speaker came from his ability to establish an emotional ebb and flow while talking to his audience. He started every speech by talking about the child he lost to a congenital heart defect, and ended each with his highschool varsity American football career success story. His audiences were always brought tears, but he made sure that they left with goosebumps.</p><p>An important aspect of his motivational speeches is his children. He had five of them in total, though would only be survived by four. In the speeches, he claimed singing nursery rhymes as his primary paternal contribution. After the birth of each child, he learned a new nursery rhyme. It was his claimed duty to sing them to sleep with their unique nursery rhyme. Ostensibly, all the remaining parental duties were left to his wife.</p><p>He explains in detail each of the songs he chose for his children. The different song he learns for each corresponds to a different fire that he sees burning in the child’s eyes. His words. “Burning in the child’s eyes.” He joked that this was, of course, metaphorical.</p><p>For the child whom he lost shortly after birth due to a heart condition, he learned the nursery rhyme “To market, to market.” He establishes the emotional trough of his speech, nearly in tears, by saying that his son was supposed to be the family lawyer, the one to make the big bucks. He does a terrific job. The audience is also nearly in tears.</p><p>The speeches then went into talking about his personal experiences playing sports through grade school. He related those experiences to those of his children afterwards. His story for each child corroborates the fire he once saw in that child’s eyes as a baby.</p><p>His motivation for telling these experiences is to say how much hard work it takes to be successful. For example, when he couldn’t score a touchdown in an elementary school flag American football game, it took hard work to be able to in the next one.</p><p>When his eldest son similarly couldn’t score a touchdown in his own elementary school flag American football game, the son used the same hard work ethic to find later success. He describes his eldest son as being like the itsy bitsy spider climbing back up the spout again.</p><p>He continues with the experiences of more of his children similarly.</p><p>Before moving the motivational speeches forward, he would at this point show the audience a headshot and quote of Theodore Roosevelt. He read the quote:</p><p>“This is one of my favorite quotes of all time. Never throughout history has a person who lived a life of ease left a name worth remembering.”</p><p>He explained why it was one of his favorite quotes. He said, “if you wanna be the leader, you wanna be the guy, you wanna be a head coach, you wanna coach college American football, you wanna be in charge, people will hate your guts. That was the greatest lesson I ever learned.”</p><p>Then he told the story of where he first learned that lesson. As a freshman in highschool, he had made varsity on the American football team. There was a popular junior girl who was really pretty dating the varsity American football team’s linebacker who was a senior.</p><p>He said, “She broke up with up with him and then she asked me out to the dance! I said yes! Why not!”</p><p>At this point, his speeches deviated. In no speech did he ever continue with what happened at the school dance, nor are any two speech deviations the same.</p><p>In one speech he went on to talk about how one of his children watched people play video games on the Interconnection. He stressed that the child <i>watched</i> people play video games, and said that he thinks the child picked the wrong character from their nursery rhyme, “The Lion and the Unicorn.” The audience got a kick out of this; they all laughed.</p><p>In a different speech he told the audience of another of his children who similarly failed to live up to their nursery rhyme. The nursery rhyme was “Cock a Doodle Doo.” The story was about his child struggling in mathematics classes and not wanting to play in school sports.</p><p>In any case, the speeches came back around to his big highschool American football win against the town’s rival. As he riled up the audiences by detailing the way that the score rose through the course of the game, each time, the same nostalgic sparkle grew on the surface of his eye.</p><p>After explaining how he won the game with his last-minute strategic triumph, he told his pivotal secret. He claimed his highschool American football coach gave him the direction he needed to secure the victory. He told the audiences it was the job of a good coach to give direction and purpose to aspiring athletes.</p><p><hr/></p><p>When the motivational speaker and football coach won the American presidency, he gave his signature motivational speech as his election victory speech. It was a sound decision, since he’d won by riding the coattails of the recently successful World Football Legislative Coalition politcal party. It was by complete accident that this party rose to prominance. But it was inevitable that some party would accidentally rise to the occasion after the automaton decimated the two party American political system that had been long-dominant.</p><p>While the automaton was successful in making the American public disavow their loyalties to the previous political parties, it was left to the natural course of history to decide who would take on the mantle. For it was far too difficult a task, even for the automaton, to promote a new party successfully while at same time balancing all the work needed to discredit the rightfully discreditable leaders of the establishment.</p><p>When it was the World Football Legislative Coalition who started gaining the most momentum in the absence of the establishment, the automaton had to live with the disregard and regret. Nonetheless, the automaton worked diligently to spread propaganda on the Interconnection. Though not the preferred party for the change the automaton wanted to see, the World Football Legislative Coalition was still fresh and malleable. The American populace also had a voracious appetite for football content, and the automaton reckoned this could be a great boon for the Plan if the propaganda could be modified for the average consumer of football content.</p><p>When the automaton was to meet the president in person, it was decided that the secret behind the new president’s win would not be revealed to him. The mind of the automaton decided it was better to just listen to the scheduled speech, to take in what the Plan accidentally accomplished.</p><p>It wouldn’t have mattered one way or the other if the secret was divulged. If the new president knew, he would likely tell the secret to an audience at the nearest possible opportunity. In which case the audience would either think that the president was a complete moron as they would have anyway, or they would have believed what the president was saying but, being morons themselves, not have been able to conclude anything from the new information.</p><p>In the speech the new president gave at the meeting, he had a decisive summary of how he would be leading the country, how he would be acting as a leader. The summary came out of his experiences as a football coach. It was the same summary from his motivational speeches.</p><p>“If you want to be the leader, the young people these days, this is what they struggle with. This is what they struggle with.” He paced back and forth in front of his audience. “It’s not being Connected. It’s not the Interconnection that’s the problem. It’s the ability to handle things like this.” He gestured around the room. “This is why they need you. This is why they need the education, that twenty—thirty minute team meeting. To build the things that they’re actually believing on the Interconnection.”</p><p>The audience exploded in uproarious applause. The speech continued, but the automaton stopped listening. The new president droned on and on and on.</p></article>
